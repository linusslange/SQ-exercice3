# Stack
This repository contains a Stack class, which works like you would expect a Stack to work. It can be initialized with a certain size and has five different methods:
- isEmpty: which returns if the stack is empty or not
- pop: which removes the top element in the stack
- push: which adds an elemnt to the stack
- size: which returns the size of the stack
- top: which returns the top element of the stack

## Installation & Usage
You can just clone the repository and use the Stack class in your own files without any additional imports or installations.

## Testing
The StackTest.java file tests the five different methods of the class.
